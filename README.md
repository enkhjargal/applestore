# Reserve and Pickup notifier for the Apple Store.

I just made this project to reserve the new iPhone 13 Pro Max with Sierra Blue color after spending almost two days checking eligibility by refreshing the webpage.

This little program helped me to save a lot of time. Also, the well-known phrase was proved again by me.

> Programmers are tiny gods

## Installation
Before installing the dependencies you must have node.js installed on your system. (Please read more about Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org))
```console
npm install
```
Make sure you have installed the project dependencies properly. If you did it right way you'll see **package-lock.json** file in the main directory. 

## Running a script
You need to open a terminal on your computer then type the following command.
```console
npm run start
```

## Testing
I have tested this software on the macOS Monterey only.
